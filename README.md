## Context
The data is technical spec of cars. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository which contains one row per car model.

## Content

### 1. Sources:
This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is
maintained at ***Carnegie Mellon University**** and was 
used in the July 7, 1993 American Statistical Association Exposition.

### 2.	Relevant Information:
This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in
the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in
predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed 
because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original 
dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".
"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon,
to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous
attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)

### 3.	Number of Instances: 398. Number of Attributes: 9 

### 4.	The Data Dictionary 

Mpg:	Miles per Gallon.

cylinders:	No. of Cylinders.

displacement:	Engine size.

horsepower:	Engine power.

Weight:	Car weight.

acceleration: how fast can accelerate in seconds

model_year:	Car year model.

Origin:	Car country of manufacture.

car_name:	Car model.

## Inspiration
I have used this dataset for practicing my exploratory analysis skills and bulding a machine learning model to predict mileage per gallon.
